     <p>Nursery may be referred to as a place where plants are grown for transplanting, for use as stock for budding
         and grafting, or for sale. Plants are commonly grown from seed or from cuttings i.e. vegetative propagation and
         are often grown in pots or other temporary containers.
         Agricultural crop nurseries are temporary in nature, and the land area used for these is later used for cultivation.
         This is done to reduce the workload and time required to handle large areas under cultivation and make fertilizers available better. <br/>

 <h2>introduction</h2>
 <p>Nursery management plays a pivotal role in the successful cultivation of vegetables, serving as the foundation for healthy<br/>
 and robust plant growth. The nursery environment must provide controlled conditions conducive to seed germination,<br/>
 fostering healthy root development and sturdy stems in seedlings. Critical practices such as adequate watering,<br/>
 nutrient provision, pest and disease control, and gradual hardening off before transplanting ensure the resilience and <br/>
 adaptability of the young plants. Varietal selection and the creation of an ideal growth environment, with attention to spacing,<br/>
 irrigation, and environmental factors, form the cornerstone of effective nursery management. A well-managed nursery sets <br/>
 the stage for successful vegetable cultivation, contributing significantly to higher yields and healthy crop establishment in the main field.<br/>
 This article encapsulates key aspects of nursery management in vegetable cultivation. It encompasses seed selection, <br/>
 optimal germination practices, and meticulous care of seedlings.<br/>
