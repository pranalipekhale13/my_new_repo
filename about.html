    <h2>IMPORTANCE </h2>
    <h3>nurseries important</h3>
    <P>Nurseries are essential in agriculture for propagating and nurturing plants before they are moved to their final
         growing spot. They help in cultivating various plants like fruits, vegetables, ornamental plants, and trees by
          providing ideal conditions for growth. Nurseries aid in developing robust root systems and ensuring the health 
         and vitality of young plants. Farmers and gardeners benefit from nurseries by increasing crop success rates
         prolonging growing seasons, and effectively handling plant production. Moreover, nurseries utilize methods like
           grafting, budding, and tissue culture to enhance genetic diversity and resilience in propagated plants.</P><br/>
